## Journey Through Code - React Version

### Overview
This project is a React version of the "Journey Through Code" personal portfolio website. It aims to recreate the functionality and design of the original static website using React components.

## Inspiration

The "Journey Thru Code" project takes inspiration from how I started my software development journey - by simply signing up on the ALX Website and submitting my CV so you can see that I'm trying to exit the same way I entered when it comes to this project. Overall it aims to create an engaging and interactive web experience, showcasing the power of modern web technologies. This project serves as a learning tool and a demonstration of various web development techniques.

### Features
- **Sticky Header**: The header remains fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls down.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Smooth scrolling effect is applied when navigating through sections.
- **Tab Navigation**: Interactive tabs allow users to switch between different sections of content.
- **Platform Navigation**: Users can navigate between different platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) to view content.
- **Responsive Menu**: The navigation menu adapts to different screen sizes and can be toggled open/closed on small screens.
- **Form Submission**: Users can submit inquiries via a form, which sends data to a Google Sheets backend.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.
